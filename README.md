# Liver-cancer-early-screen-based-on-image-and-deep-learning

##Objective
In this project, we want to utilize deep learning-based algorithms to predict the liver cancer(HCC) at the early stage.

## Details
The major liver disease screenning methods include ultrosound, CT and MR. Due to the limit of radiation dose, doctors use MR scans to monitor the high risk patients. During those patients visits, there are both CT and MR scans. In order to make full use of those trajectory data, there is an urgent need to convert those images from one domain to another. Most of the current liver and tumor segmentation models are trained on CT images as there are some abdomen CT dataset public availabe. Thus, we developed a novel style information guided CT/MT transformation system, shown in the following figure.
